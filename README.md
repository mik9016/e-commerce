# E-Commerce

Example of a shop with all necesarry features it needs. Project created from need of using recently learned skills.
I also really wanted to implement payment gateway and check out the Stripe API.

## So what it does?
Functionalities:
- show all items avaliable for sale
- show particular item
- Add item to cart
- delete item from cart
- change quantity of items in cart
- calculate total price in cart
- redirect to stripe and pay
- redirect to success or failure page from stripe

## Stack
1. Frontend :
- NuxtJS
- SCSS
- JS
- STRIPE

2. Backend:
- Laravel
- PHP
- MariaDB
- mysql
- STRIPE

## Payment

1. Go ahead and try out going through the payment using test credentials:
    - Creditcard number: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
    - Rest of the form can be random 
    - It is test mode so no one will be charged!

## Site Hosting:
- site is live under: https://shop.mgruszecki.com/

## More Funcionalities

I also plan to develop site more. Here is what i'm going to add:
- login logout for admin
- simple CMS where i can add/ remove items in shop
- img upload
- mail-confirmation of the order
